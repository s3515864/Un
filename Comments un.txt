We just voted to allow those who abuse her to continue to do so unfettered as long as doing so lines the pockets of those that need it least. Greed voted and won.  Fear voted and won. The skies are bleak and troubled outside my window today.   The earth is an entity. She is a living being in her own right and we act like parasites  that scurry around and undermine her every effort to keep us sustained.   We bar her waterways and drain her sub basins, we pollute her air so not even the cleansing rain she sends forth actually cleanses. We choke her with our debris.  We pluck her other children from the earth and discard them as though they do not matter.  To most, they don't.  We slaughter, we torture, we slash, we burn. We take from her depths and use it against her. We rape her repeatedly.  We use, abuse and discard.  In all honesty maybe we don't deserve to be here.  I'm sure she will find a way to rid herself of us eventually.  A change of government wasn't going to miraculously fix things, but it would have been a start. A small spark of hope.  A beginning. So I guess I will continue to keep a spark of hope and light burning within.  Every kind deed, every rescue, every seed planted is hope.  One spark of light can lighten a pitch black room.  Gather all the sparks together and it is a force to be reckoned with.  It's time to light up the world instead of wallowing in the darkness."Australian Young Greens Finally some good news... well apart from the good news from Warringa!Dan doesn't understand how elections work. Poor Dan :(Sarah Hamilton yeh I do liberals won🤣🤣 they saved this country from labor and greensTina Spencer some good news :)Sarah Hamilton nor does he understand what the liberals actually do lmaoKimi OngFred Michael Shaw I needed that xI wonder if people voted green which pulled the vote from labor?Greens didn’t make it 💚💚Issy Kenne 🙌🏽Fred Michael Shaw ah thank you!Fred Michael Shaw why would greens voters preference liberals over Labor?Kahli Finn although their ideals don’t line up exactly the greens align closer to labor over liberal. Eg. labor actually has some idea on how they want to tackle climate issues vs liberal still not believing in it.Thank you for some positive thoughts!!!Australian Young Greens thank god 💚💚💚"Tayla Macdonald he said Liberals OVER Labour. Not Labour over Liberals. I'm assuming it was simply a mistake, but I'd rather be certain""Yes, but, considering this was ""the Climate Election"", i was expecting a lot more"🙏🏻 Carla MarangelliTina Spencer noDan Campbell ignore and block trolls like this"Tina Spencer the Greens preferences went Labor, thing is Labor policies were simply not trusted, they went after the single largest voting block retirees and the little Mum and Dad investors ( the policy wouldn’t have worried the big guys ( both Sco Mo and Bill are in this group), it was just too big a risk, of being simply used as a piggy back for a party with a very poor money managing history."Tina Spencer add what the QLD state Labor gov is doing they were always going to struggle in QLD especially in the bush.1 MP got reelected lmaoAustralian Young Greens Jamez Scardigno 👍🏻👍🏻Dan Campbell saved from what?"Pat Olavi Dan is the troll, you missed his less than eloquent comment that was deleted."Dan Campbell  saves this country my rse they did.. I wish them a senate from hell.. they deserve nothing lessWell at least there's some good news out of all this..Australian Young Greens Jess McAllister Kieran Pengelly Natalie Duddell Amber-Rose Fall Emma Reardon"Some more good news, every single Greens Senator and MP has been re-elected on a bigger vote 💚💚"...and 9 senators"Australian Young Greens whoopie doo, haven’t you got some protesting to go do ?"Joshua Lambourn Haven't you got anything better to do than trying to be a big man on Facebook?Liam BradyJoshua Lambourn Woke human Joshua thinks posting not‐as‐witty‐as‐he‐thinks Facebook comments on those with opposing views’ pages makes him coolJosh Ryan from your profile pic alone I can tell what kinda kid you are or were in school.Joshua Lambourn someone who actually graduated?Joshua Lambourn I'll take that as a noJoshua Lambourn trollAustralian Young Greens  your only voters are high school graduate bushpig girlsJoshua Lambourn Ooh and what kind of kid was that?? I’m keen to knowYou guys won 1 seat in house of reps..."Sure, but it does show that the Australian vote can be bought. Clive may not have won a seat but his campaign won the election for the LNP. This is a sad day for Australian democracy but hope the this election can facilitate a change in the thinking of voters in the future."Can a bunch of come with you?Melinda Ceresoli yep I'll book a charter flight. No visa required.Can you add 3 seats for my family pleaseNot enough consolation. I'm seeking political asylum in new Zealand."No he spent 80m to keep the ALP out of office, and he succeeded in cleaving huge chunks of protest votes away from the ALP and funnelling preferences back toward the LNP. Don't trivialise what happened, it was blindingly successful at securing his own interests. Most of that spending was ALP attack ads. And whist the ALP aren't the most progressive party, it's a hell of a lot better than ScoMo"Max Orritt he wasn’t allowed to pay out of his other assets to pay his workers he wanted to do it. But Legal system stoped himStoney Daniels and i’m sure that donation he gave to that family member was the legal system stopping him too. the legal system promotes franking credits lmao"Stoney Daniels legal systems don’t stop you from paying your workers lol, he probably shouldn’t have those other assets if you can’t pay your worked""it’s the money he never gave to his workers, so in reality, he hasn’t lost anything"His preferences won Qld for lnp tho...Izaak Gregory sadly this was the case 😞Yeeeaaaaaaahh but he probably won Queensland for LNP.Looks that wayTim Jansen I wish working class people realised that a vote for One Nation or Palmer is just a round about vote for the Coalition."Me too Daniel. But we don't have a broad left working class movement in Australia though, and most people aren't interested in building one."Tim Jansen that is the fault of all on the left regardless of colour. We need to resonate a popular message that gives the working class hope.Daniel AbsolutelyBut he won the election for the Coalition"May not have won a seat, but he has won support for his mega-mine next to Adani's Carmichael mine. That's what he was after all along."Kate Poynter how disappointing is the reality of this whole electionThe only hope is that people will come together now and take to the streets and demand change.  The system is broken!Or he could have used it to pay his workers a proper wage..."Kate Poynter, or could have gone towards the millions he owes the former workers of QLD Nickel"Money that could have been spent eliminating Homelessness.  I can't believe it wasn't an election issue.  Farrrrrk we live in shit times :(Shae Evans sameShae Evans agreedShae Evans i AM cryingShae Evans please do lmaoShae Evans I already am cryingLeftist tears"Lefties always sook when it doesn't go their way. It's the trump win all over again, Australian style."I wanna cry over the fact liberal is winningWas worth every penny and all the time I spent volunteering to gat closer to a better world"You do realise that he was a shareholder? Not an owner and he did give money to the people during the campaign, he set aside 10 millions dollars for everyone if I remember correctly."I shouldn’t laugh: those poor ex QNI workers will never get their money nowThe 80 million he saved on the tears and sweat of his workforce and dodging tax? Glad that ponderous wind bag will scuttle back under the media radar and we don't have to see his face that resembles a bonobo's...not faceI guess no one is getting paid this month.tfw admin doesnt realise that palmer's $80m is what got the libs in government lol  JaneAnd won Queensland and the keys to the Galiliee basin.....and ....now i wonder what excuse clive will have not to pay his workers as promised ....cause he will act all crazy again and not pay themat least 1?"according to the abc, 6."1 😂😂😂😂"Not enough, why?"Are you aware of something called the Senate mate?Liz King are you aware that you are stack hat wearing crayon eating fucktardsCheers mate 😂How many have the greens won? 😂😂😂😂"Ummmm, unfortunately there are also his preferences to consider"This is a UAP candidate saying what he thinks about thisI wonder what he gets in mining royalties when LNP push through licenses though?He got the libs in though 👿Awesome ...clive and tony can go catch a fast train....as far as i m concerned   😂😁😀It’s ok he has another forty thousand million more dollarydoos to keep him afloat 🙃True. Although preferences from his party no doubt helped the L/NP :(Still managed to give preferences to the Libs though. 😑"You know what, I'm gonna be taking comfort in that honestly"He could have saved lives with that money thousands of livesNo skin off his nose at all haha just a tax dodge👌When do we vote for QUexit?"I remember all the times they won seats and helped bring about positive action like gay marriage rights, and a royal commission into banking corruption."remember that time greens won an election?"Yeah he only preferenced the Libs to victory, and will build his billion dollar mine, I’m sure he’s crushed."But he now does get his mine's approved no questions askedI knew this page would ease my pain....... Somewhat.Rachel Kelly trueee gonna keep buying those coffees now. Also cos I’m gonna have so much more money now the Libs are in yayayKylie Blyth preferences tho 😑"Adam Blyth I will miss all the calls, texts and ads. Clive was my only friend."Adam Blyth this is a little spirit raiser. Although he did ultimately effect the result at least we have to see him snoozing in parliament.But you can pretty much buy everything else."Lesson here kids, is that you can’t buy respect."That was just on YouTubeHe won the government though"Yeah but that wasn't really his goal anyway, was it?"Every cloud has a silver lining.$2.76 per primary vote."Ash 'Spook' Wiren Heya! Just curious :) How did you get to your figure?  My first one was $80,000,000 / 24,600,000 The second from $80,000,000 / (5,071,000 / 7 (senate seats up for election + 1)) Which came out about $110, which I fudged upwards a bit because people under 18 can't vote :("Fred Michael Shaw i think the $2.76 is what her gets PAID per vote.Katie Lambley thanks :D"I think Anthony Green from ABC just quoted $1,500 per lower house vote paid by Clive Palmer!"$3.25 for each Australian ... or about $140 for each vote he would have needed in Qld to take a senate quota.Wait till the sue him for not paying the advertising bill 😂Yeah but he got the libs in.You’ll find that $80m was most probably tax deductible"And Violent left group"" get up"" was funded by labor, unions and greens."Alice Farmer Santana Calabro Maddie Lambert thinking about all the money I spent this week and how much worse next week is going to beNot when it’s been stolen by Palmer. ThankThanks....I needed that 🤣Gabby Pieri 😂😂😂 absolutelyKelly Kayne I see you’ve already liked this but this is how I’m justifying my coffee expenditure.Lily Geddes oh I would not doubt it for a second.But isn’t a vote for the greens a vote for the ALP?^lmao this isn’t the same as preference deals.Yeah but he got LNP in which was probably his plan all along. Sacrifice a seat to get LNP in."His preferences went to the LNP, helping them secure QLD. He is now going to ask for concessions/favours on from the LNP""Yes, but unfortunately he was so successful at bad mouthing the ALP in his ad campaign that they lost."That does make me feel better lol 😂A lesson for everyone. It is not easy to predict an election result.Sharnie Connell please share this more!!!Rae SturgessI’m sfreenshotting and sharing this everywhere is that okay?Sharnie Connell Or just don't and get it through your thick head that the Majority of Australians voted for the liberals to retain power and keep looking after our country. Stop acting like a 4 year old who didn't get his own way dipshit"So we live in a country as beautiful as Australia and people are trying to rebel 🤔  Damn, really gonna work..."Sharnie Connell when you sign up there’s no drop down option for SAPlease start something.

In fact it should be part of the mandated process at every polling booth.Cherie Allardice they did at mine ☺️Sarah Christou imagine how much paper would be saved if every polling station in Australia had to do itCherie Allardice I was thinking this also! Such a waste"Or better get, make voting online or through mygov. Such a waste of time, paper, and money atm.""I'm not sure what was there at your voting, but we had a recycling bin to put everything into that we didn't want.""Cherie Allardice we gave ours back, it would be good if they encouraged everyone to"Cherie Allardice I was handing out cards and was encouraging people to hand them back when they were done. We also made sure there were recycling bins at each exit as all that was set up before hand were landfill bins"Where I went everyone was encouraged to put them either in the massive recycling bin they had at the exit, or hand them back.""Hahaha I did exactly that today 😂 Also as a side note why don’t  the Greens encourage people to return their how to vote cards so they can be re-used?, Or even every party’s  how to vote cards? All it would take is one member from each party standing at the exit for people to hand them back, or even a box for each party for people to place them in. You literally use them for a few minutes then they go straight in the bin, which is a huge waste of paper. I’d even settle for a recycling bin at the exit at the very least. We need to walk the talk."Nicola Joy the labor government saw many more deaths than under the liberals"James Folbigg I don’t have the figures to check it, but that seems plausible."Nicola Joy they are just volunteers"I have a friend who said to the LNP volunteer trying to give her a paper, “Is that for mopping up the blood of refugees?!” They went pale. 😂"Amber Finlay  and how many seats do the greens have in the lower house?"While handing out how to vote cards today I was so happy with the amount of people who completely dodged everyone else to come get only a greens card, made my day 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻"Sure you all got hit with a healthy dose of reality tonight 😂"Nic Cirillo would have been better to return it to the volunteer or not take one at all, no one is forcing progressive social politics on you!"I think my course of action was far more enjoyableNic Cirillo yesssss 😂"Nic Cirillo , lets see if that joke is still funny in 20yrs time""Leif Jackson in 20 years time the greens will he disbanded after inner-city Melbourne wakes up and realises they’re a massive meme, making my joke EVEN better"Helping with your recycling efforts 🥰🥰 Go greenies!!I feel ripped off.

Sometimes I find things boring as my attention span is small, but it's important to hand out how to vote brochures."Just be friendly with a smile. Most people will respond in kind.  And if anyone has a d*!khead remark to make just remember haters gonna hate. Keep up the good work 👍🤙🌱"Koran Mounì Just be yourself and give everyone a big smile! Most people are great and they’ll have some good discussions with you, whenever I’ve volunteered people from all walks of life and opinions were happy to chat with me even if they didn’t vote Greens, but also just walk away from anyone who is being rude or unkind, you don’t have to engage 🙂"Australian Young Greens It appears that a lot of greens voters aren't as chilled as you seem to say others are.

Tell me your superior ways!""No jokes, the LNP volunteer at my polling place was shocked when after very politely and confidently declining her how to vote card, I strolled back it again in under five minutes. She stopped me and asked if I minded having a quick chat with her. She was genuinely blown away that I went in there knowing precisely what to do without the assistance of any how to vote bs.

However voting 1 for the greens did not resonate."I did hand outs today it was great haha, liberal and labour really hated me and my sister but once they realised we didn't care and we still would be friendly we all ended up having nice conversations while we handed stuff out. Had a few nut cases and the other party volunteers helped with. Vote 1 the greens.""Liberals guy looked at me, made an assessment, didn't bother me.

Both us and labor continually asked and received back the forms for reuse. The greens alone are not the only ones that recycle.  The polite thing to do would be take every form, give a pleasant Thankyou and return them on leaving as many POLITE people did.  I think people like you were using the moment to make a point that only came  across to all if of as rude and self righteousness. I did not have any rude labor people in three weeks of passing out how to votes. However the abuse and foul language was from the greens was very disappointing and not what I expected thinking the greens were nice caring people. I found many of their volunteers were just this and we worked well together but their voters were a different story. Shame  as its stops other people listening to their message .""Literally me today: Walks past the Liberal, Labor and Greens who all tried to hand me a flyer. My response: “Nah, I’m good thanks.

So,  anyway.. I'm on your side and I love this meme.. But the problem I want to bring to your attention Australian Young Greens, is that this meme came into my fb feed about five minutes after another one of yours that kind of patronisingly told us not to tell anyone how to vote..  😕   As I am aware it's according to  party policy. I respect the stance. Don't do the labor rank and file thing please. Its worked out disastrously for their left faction and continues to. As you can see its inherently contradictory, not as a reflection of you folks but as,a method. On levels. I'm telling people to vote green. Some disparage me for it, some ignore it, some listen. I back it up with reasons that people can judge for themselves. I get into tons of heated arguments doing it.

They have given me carpel tunnel syndrome from constantly fast forwarding through them"Media blackout starts tonight. Though apparently it won't affect catch up/streaming services, only broadcast TV. Unlikely that it'll affect YouTube etc either.""Cameron, yeah, cos people who live in inner Melbourne who voted in Bandt have no jobs but can afford to live there 🙄""Matt PH Like Adam Bant is the only Greens politician in the country.   ""The Daily Telegraph can reveal Nimbin and Lismore, home of the Australian Hemp Party and new Greens’ heartland, have one of the highest rates of welfare recipients in the state. The north coast region, where the Greens claimed a historic win in Ballina and came close to taking Lismore at the weekend election, has more than 32,000 residents on welfare, including 14,000 on the Newstart allowance.""""Cameron,   As of 2016, Nimbin has a labour force (persons 15+ looking for work or currently working) of 813 people. Unemployment rate of 13.7%.  Lismore City has a labour force of 19,699. Unemployment rate of 6.6%.  In 2016 election there were 1,385,651 first preference votes for the greens, yet you’ve focused on a tiny fraction of that vote to represent the entirety of their support.  The Daily Telegraphs selective  “reporting” is from 2015, there was a census since then. Learn to do your own research instead of repeating Murdoch’s propaganda.   Also, it’s referred to as the Northern Rivers Region, not the North Coast Region, unless the Daily Telegraph is making it up as it goes 🤷🏼‍♂️""Matt PH   You cant compare the final 2016 electoral results to the 2015 stats from one or two areas.   I'd like to see that status of those 1.3 million Green voters as I suspect a considerable percentage don't work.  People who dont work vote for parties that steal in excess from people that do for ""redistribution"". If you work full time and have a home and a family to support the last thing you want is to pay more taxes and support a more centralised government. You vote for parties that will tax you less and give you more freedom.  It's not rocket science, unless your an idiot which i suspect your not.  The Greens are just power thirsty socialists poorly guised as champions of climate action and equality. No different from the hellish socialist parties of abject horror that preceeded them.""Cameron,   You’re making negative generalizations on over a million people based on the worst figures the Daily Telegraph could find of a minuscule proportion of the country, and even then, they skewed the figures.   There’s no actual data that those people on welfare even voted green, just assumptions.   And you do this despite the fact you could look at the NSW state electorates of Balmain or Newtown which are actually HELD by the Greens, not just came close as you are focusing on 🤷🏼‍♂️  Again, do your own research rather than repeat the constant opinion pieces and editorials of a clearly biased “newspaper”.""Matt PH No its a logical conclusion that people who don't work vote for parties that offer free stuff taken from people that do.   If anything the report Is just the tip of the iceberg.  But fishing around I found this.   ""About 70 per cent of Greens voters in inner Melbourne are rich, dislike unions and think suburban people are backwards, ­racist and bigoted, Labor has concluded based on its own research.""  So Greens voters are wellfare blugers or elitist snobs who dispise working people.""Again, you are using a small sample to make assumptions about over a million voters. You’re using selective emotive “data” designed to cause division in our society to assert your own prejudice against people who you think vote for the greens""Matt PH lol theres nothing emotive about statistics. And are you serious? The heart of Greens doctrine is division. It's entire philosophy of the Greens and the Left in general is pitting groups against eachother. They pitt women against men, poor against rich and fanatics against everyday rational people. The Greens are no different from the Soviets as far as political philosophy is concerned. Green on the outside red on the inside.""You still have yet to back up your assertion with factual information that green voters don’t work. You keep weaseling your way into unrelated stereotypes, prejudices and slogans."Not like Greens voters actually work.they should and willShouldn't the ads be stopping after midnight tonight?"Maria Kristina go on the DNC register.

They’re not breaking the law by not paying their consensual volunteers. If you have a contract that states you are to receive payment in return for your work, and then your employer doesn’t pay you, that’s breaking the law."Cat Benstead I know what a contract is.   The reality is your party relies massively on people who will never ever be paid who put in countless amounts of hours knowing that.   Not paying your staffers absolutely stinks but so does wilfully headhunting volunteers"MJ you do realise that every party uses volunteers right?

Anyway can’t vote because I’m too young.Samuel Farley so your one of those gimps that thinks the Sunday rate of a coffee maker should be $40 an hour under a labor government? Who needs small business anyway right? Socialist.Thomas Clarke this meme is  self fulfilling prophecy"If you cannot support a living wage for your workers why are you running a business? Why does the business owner get to throw workers into poverty for their own ambitions? The growing underemployment bracket, now pinged to exceed 10% of the country, is a burgeoning area of financial instability."Scott Heiner you work for what you get. You shouldn’t just be given a living wage. You have to work for your money. Stop wanting handouts. Some small businesses can’t afford to pay there workers much until the business starts to get going. If ur unhappy with ur wage work harder or go start ur own thing. Stop sooking."I wasn’t implying people weren’t working. That was your assumption, that people are paid for their work. But this is not true when we look at the figures, at the expanding casual workforce, companies not willing to hire people on full time contracts. Why do we have to support the business’s venture before it gets off the ground? Won’t the free market decide if the business can succeed or fail?  I’m not here to say that small business can’t exist, but when automation is driving down the workforce and the market is becoming saturated, I think the conversations need to change. If you think you have the next great idea, great! Time to put your funding where your idea is and pay people adequately to bring it to fruition."Duarte Cerqueira AugustoMaybe because our parents weren’t dumb enough to vote green?

Can you provide an explanation of how their policies are the same?"Certainly i will explain, Also before i do i never said they had the same policy but you dont have 1 without the other. We all know that the liberals and nationals formed together because liberal was under threat from labor when labor was formed and to retain government The nationals and liberals merged - however the difference between them is the nationals and liberals do not have the same policies as strictly speaking nationals generally stick to country areas but can cross over. up until 2010 the greens were a separate organisation until the election of 2010 when to form government the Labor party retained the government by forming a minor government with 3 independants and the greens, since then the 2 parties have worked together in both the house and senate to achieve political victory. All of labors policies in the last 9 years has kept the greens in mind to keep them on side and you often find labor backing up the greens statements with policy as the greens do not have the numbers. If you ever watch a Q&A with a greens member, a labor member, and a liberal member on the panel - 1 thing is obvious, the greens member will interrupt the liberal member but not interrupt the labor member.

Its not the sun – which hasn’t changed much since 1850 Its not volcanos – which actually cool the Earth for a year or two after they erupt Its not aerosols – as they help to reflect more of the sun’s energy back to space Its not changes in land use –as the conversion of dark forest to paler pasture which reflects more of the sun’s light and actually has a modest cooling effect Ozone pollution – from human activities warm things a bit Greenhouse gases – rising concentrations of greenhouse gases as the result of human activity are by far the biggest cause When we compare human and natural factors its clear what is responsible for global warming…. human activity. Also note: A greenhouse gas is any gas in the atmosphere which absorbs heat and thereby keeps the planets atmosphere warmer that it would otherwise be. The main greenhouse gases are water vapour, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone and some synthetic gases such as chlorogluorcarbons and hyrdroflurocarbons. Because c02 is considered the most important greenhouse gas some fools or reports only include co2, this can lead to an understatement of total global warming impact.  For your knowledge :methane and nitrous oxide concentrations are mostly derived from agriculture and just in case you didn’t realise Australia is a major agricultural producer and exporter"Katie Innes so in short you’re saying we need to cull cows as they fart too much. Have you smelt country air before?Justin Filipovich I don’t have solutions mate I’m just not dumb enough to think that global warming isn’t a direct result of human activityKatie Innes but you think we as humans can alter the weather?Justin Filipovich yepJustin Filipovich FYI up to 95% of the emissions actually come from the cows mouth ie burping not from farts.Katie Innes is that based on the same scientists that claim the man made climate change theory?Justin Filipovich and yours ? A Facebook memeI think you should stop smoking that funny stuffJustin Filipovich do some research. I can help you. I’ll teach you how to find information that is credible and supportedJust because you think it comes from a reliable or credible source does not make it 100% credible or reliable. Do you believe everything you are taught or do you ask your own questions? You have to take in  consideration political bias and vested interestsLiiissstteenn I always question and find answers myself but I look to sources of information that are backed and supported by facts. It’s not hard. You can be a scientist skeptic all you like but come to the party with a bit more than a pic off facey"Katie Innes ok, answer me 1 question. How many genders are there?"Justin Filipovich you’ll just disagree with whatever i sayBut 2"I’ve just spent the last 20 minutes trying to find something to support your man-made climate change is a hoax claim, the best I can find is solar cycles are responsible.

In fact, they were the very reason it took so long since they frustrated the process and every step and wasted public money on a useless survey that told us what we already knew through legitimate polling."But they still were the party to process the bill. So shove your self elsewhere.Doug Crowley   They were dragged there - kicking and screaming- by public opinion!  😏"Doug Crowley Only incidentally, after increasing public pressure. The country and parliament was more than ready for Marriage Equality but they were still the ones putting up roadblocks. And they didn’t take them down, like Labor did, we, the people smashed through them. We have marriage equality DESPITE the far-right controlled Coalition, not because of them. They forfeited the right to any credit when they abdicated their responsibility with the postal survey. If they wanted credit, they should have just had a free vote.""Labour would have been the ones to pass Marriage Equality if it weren't for the Liberals, they made sure is wouldn't pass. Crediting them for being the ones to ""finally pass Marriage Equality"", is like crediting someone for being ""the first person to patent this invention"", when the idea had already been conceived, developed, and finalised by other people, and he prevented them from taking it to the patent office.""Labor voted against it in government too, Dan"Go vote greens and see where the country goes. I don’t care for you’re opinion"Doug Crowley They are not opinions, they are easily verifiable facts. The process is just as important as the result and the Liberals were the ones who were muddying up the process, every step of the way.""Hamish Taylor Until they changed their policy to a free vote. Then the only major party to still vote against it was the Coalition. It was also the John Howard government who quietly rushed the change to the Marriage Act back in 2004, instead of allowing the High Court to consider the matter. They didn’t even debate the matter in parliament or ask the public for their opinion. The Liberals were always the main opposition to the reform and they are no allies to LGBTIQ people on any of our issues."The liberals actually introduced discrimination into the Marriage Act in 2004 under John Howard (the previous version of the act hadn't specify that marriage had to be between a man and a woman) & Labor voted with them to pass this chanage at the time.Liberals made the bill for gay marriage and it got passedSam Bishop you don’t get to throw around the word autistic as though it’s an insult ..

That may sound fine for you, but imagine if you worked hard your whole life to earn a sizeable income as a doctor/pilot/financial advisor (pilot and doctors jobs are no walk in the park) and then you get taxed higher for the sole fact that you earn more for the job you do.

THE EXTINCTION OF ALL LIFE ON EARTH"Norman - I've already had this conversation with you. You conceded that you couldn't point to a single phenomenon where there was evidence that would satisfy you. You're just trolling now and you know this.Young people: we need to drastically reshape the global economy and energy system to avoid pending ecological collapse and mass human death and misery.   Conservatives: bUt HoW aRe wE gOiNg tO pAy fOr iT?This is untrue... The liberals mailed me a load of recycling this morning!They know the price of everything and the value of nothing"Just voted, let's kick this mob out"http://www.theshovel.com.au/2019/05/03/climate-change-avoiding-wipe-out-of-humanity-not-within-budget-guidelines/"The $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package is the biggest single investment any Australian government has made in reducing emissions. This funding will help ensure we meet our Paris commitment to reduce emissions by 26-28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030.  Its centrepiece is a $2.0 billion Climate Solutions Fund, which is expected to deliver more than 100 million tonnes of emissions reduction, over and above the almost 200 million tonnes being delivered through the successful Emissions Reduction Fund.""Claire Esler How much of that gets funnelled into bigwig salaries for small foundations linked to multinational corps, i.e. like the $444m great barrier reef fund.  You realise $3.5b means nothing when a party policy still revolves around coal as the status quo, 80% of which is burnt overseas; how does it help coastal land and waterways when you have simultaneous support for oil drilling in the world's last pristine marine sanctuary (The Bight), along with further gas exploits along our coasts? Don't kid yourself that a measly [liberal promise] will have any meaningful effect on the greater climate crisis. #realitycheck"Also this 'Emissions reductions fund' sounds a lot like the tactic they already tried that didn't work - giving corporations  money for nothing and asking nicely for them to stop polluting 😂"Okay funny but inaccurate...  $3.5 billion will be invested through the Climate Solutions Package with a further $137.4 million for Practical Environment Restoration which includes funding for environmental protection projects, threatened species, the restoration of coastal land and waterways, and waste recycling. #factcheck"Not acting would cost 730 billion a year...Cluny Gilmour yeah no stress the wealth of a bunch of old men is worth more than million yr old natural wonders and the future of every young personYou'd trust a Murdoch radio host over overwhelming scientific consensus?Skinny O'Leary  always happy to hear both sides of a discussion. It’s not so much the personality but addressing the statements and seeing if their factual or not. I googled all the statements Alan Jones made and they were correct. Same time I wouldn’t wanted to be blind sighted by any political party but base my own views and opinions from what you research. It’s a on going controversial topic that needs to be challenged from both angles not swayed by politicians trying to win votes"Tony, I agree that we should look to investigate what politicians say - but I think it's important that we do as much as we can to combat climate change in Australia. Whilst we aren't a huge contributor to CO2 levels globally, if we look at local CO2 only, we do export a huge amount of coal that gets burned elsewhere - and the labor and liberal parties are happy to keep this up. Even in the US they've just had their first month ever where there was more power generated by renewables than by non-renewables. That's massive, and shows a paradigm shift. Australia could become a leader in new renewable tech (look at how well the CSIRO do on a global level) if there's an investment and interest in leading the way. We might actually make a WAY bigger impact than previously thought. Happy to discuss further with you!"Skinny O'Leary  it’s a very good point and fact you raised. Something I wasn’t aware of with USA 🇺🇸.  If they can do it at this point of time we should be able to hear in Australia 🇦🇺 do that as well.  None of the parties have been able to articulate or state that as yet. It’s the most sensible thing I’ve heard on this of recent. It shows it can be done.I e always believed that it needs to happen just Australia seem to be a long way of the mark with all parties of having a sensible balanced method of achieving this and still keeping the tap running with out disruption"It definitely does! If other countries are transitioning away from coal, there could be huge job losses in the future for Australian coal miners. The most sensible course of action would be to become a market leader in new technology, investing in jobs for our shift away from non-renewable industries. Think Ireland in the tech boom, but on a much bigger scale!""And I think you're right about no previous government having a sensible and balanced approach. The thing is, we really should have started transitioning years ago - so starting now is going to be an uphill battle. I think that's why so many young people are so passionate about this. We've been wanting to start for so long, and there's so much to do! I'm voting for the Greens so that there's a clear indication to whoever wins government that this needs to happen ASAP.""My issue there is delivering without turning of the taps causing mayhem and getting the right fit at the right price. I honestly don’t think that any of the parties are even close to getting a good outcome without disaster of some sort in this area. One thing I must say is I haven’t spoken to any one that doesn’t believe at some point of moving to renewables. It’s just about the execution and timing and not burning people or the public purse from poor execution, management and deliverance without turning of the tap. Not meaning to be negative as it does need a transition at some point""We've got less than 12 years to turn it around, according to the UN. I think the detrimental affects from doing nothing or not enough far outweigh the benefits of transitioning slowly. Transitioning will increase the job market in a huge way!""Skinny O'Leary there’s no detailed plan or costing of how they will achieve this. A bit like building a new house without knowing if you can afford it. SA and Vic went fwd with out a plan. Destroyed the town economically in Morwell where 4 bd 2 bth that were valued at 350, 000 are now $120,000.  Those states are now under Labor governments burning diesel emissions into the atmosphere as there plan/strategy and management failed. It needs to happen but with coatings and a sustainable plan on place. Can’t comment on the 12 yrs as haven’t researched"The last post from Alan Jones worth watching if you truly want to know the facts on climate change. I’m all abt the truth with accurate figures. It would appear from Alan Jones statement it’s not correct. It’s factual. Happy to hear if you say those facts he stated can be refuted.

It’s far more beneficial for scientist to push the Government narrative then not. What have all these climate change folk got out of this money lots of money.   There’s 2 genders male and female the rest are mental health issues."https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/   Why are you so hurt by the idea that gender is a spectrum?Skinny O'Leary gender is not a spectrum there’s 2 😂😂😂 the rest is  a mental health issueSkinny O'Leary posting a link from NASA who gets a lot of cash from the US government does not prove climate change. As I just mentioned scientist have more to loose if they go against the theory of man made climate change. Climate change is real it’s just not man made"If you think that science is driven by funding, rather than driven by the scientific method, you misunderstand science. Why is it that you only mistrust climate science?""The earth goes thorough cycles where it heats up or cools down, crazy hey.

Most Australians support and respect the indigenous culture - It is the essence of Australia!

The sorry was for self benefit and didn't care for Indigenous families, or for what happened in the Stolen Generation. That's why the government needs to include Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander people in parliament decision making."Jessica McColl absolutelyJessica McColl last time I checked we live in a democracy so sure if they get voted in we will have them however if they don’t they don’t saying we need more of any demographic is a ridiculous statement you either get voted in or not"But but but.......

People dont buy investment properties to then make the minimum on each week. Its sad. Need more compassion from the wealthyso....why land lordsMore Australians bought their 7th investment property last year than those that bought their 1st home.  That's the problem.  Rent rises making it harder to purchase a home and starts to get impossible to pay for those on low incomes.Mäiki Greyjoy the problem is capitalismis there a reason why we can't just fill the vacant houses already in existence?Christian ChapuisNorman Heckscher not disputing that something needs to be done.

Pedestrians only have right of way on nature strips and foothpathsDerek Lord it’s actually both hilarious and alarming how you have not demonstrated the capacity to critically reflect on the situationLK Lucardie so your saying its ok to slam a gate shut on a horse. RightoLK Lucardie lets critically reflect on the situation. 1st she willimg steeped in front of a cantering horse and tried to shut a gate on it.  2nd she hit the horse with that gate.  3rd the gate rebounded and smashed her i.e. newtons law every action has an equal and opposite reaction.   Reflection she should not have done that. In fact she should be charged with attempted murder and animal cruelty.  She tried to injure  the animal and if she had suscceded in shutting the gate the horse could have had both its forelock shatter and had to be euthanizedWhat a coward using his horse to injure someone who dares to disagree with him.Yeah it’s a massive shock that these people are arseholes."Short-sighted, narrow-minded backwards IDIOTS."Kat Wayward who the moron and thug  The guy showing off his horse and its skills to city kids who never seen a real horse in thier life and then leaving peacefully or THE PERSON WHO TRIES TO SLAM A GATE SHUT ON A RUNNING HORSE?????"I see a Queenslander has taken offence.

Each boy was driven in a separate patrol car to a swampy area in Pinkenba, Queensland. The officers threatened to throw the boys into the swampy wasteland, and referred to a place where people's fingers were cut off, in order to get them to comply with their demands. The boys were abandoned after their shoes were removed. The boys later retrieved their shoes and began to walk home. They finished the journey in a taxi paid for by a security guard they met along the way.” - Wikipedia"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/apr/26/one-nation-candidate-mark-ellis-allegedly-threatened-to-kill-employee?fbclid=IwAR23y-W5uLbCdx7E4xqwtaAWXaIHkKuYv1LZm2wXwPnM6Xzvgknhz0r6EIoIsn’t this the same guy who left politics a few years back after threatening to kill his employee?Angus Mackenzie also the fact that you’re placing your ‘bank account’ above the welfare of children is just grossenjoy your $1500 billsAngus Mackenzie enjoy killing the planetthe volcanoes will do that for us.

Or that the $4bn going to private schools should be funding public schools as a priority? Or that Early Childhood Education should be returned to public, non-profit centres as opposed to companies like Dutton’s wife’s & G8 making $24m in profit in six months? Huh. What do you consider centrist then?""Ryan Johnstone is a ""but job"" what I think it is? 🤔😱""Sharlene Henderson  I don’t want to pay for dental care, so no. It’s Australia, we have excellent private health insurers. I’d prefer to just pay for my own oral health which I can control, as opposed to the socialist arrangement where I pay for peoples dental  who live on coke and lollies.  Since early childhood learning started, I don’t see much difference in national testing outcomes, but again, I’d prefer childcare to be means tested, because if someone is qualified to flip burgers, it’s not worth paying for their child care, as opposed to professionals.  As for schools, I’ve not seen the data on what schools provide better outcomes, so I can’t comment. I went through the public school system, and from what I saw with the dregs of society going through there, the extra 4 billion would be wasted. Again, that’s just my experience and I haven’t seen the results but yeah.""Hannah Banana i think he meant ""nut job""""Scott Croker  you are lucky you have excellent health Care insurance, because you are definitely in need of psychiatric help."Scott Croker spoken like a typical person who doesn’t appreciate his privilege 😖🙄"Natasha Antcliff  what privilege?  The privilege of working in unhealthy conditions on construction sites?  The privilege of having 30% of the worth of my labour taken, 80% of which go to welfare?   The privilege of being accused by absolute losers of having an easy ride?  The privilege of being a straight white male, hence being afforded no free passes by society, or government handouts?

I’m curious as to what exactly make them socialist and why you don’t like socialism. Cause I tend to hear a lot of people say socialism based on what they heard in the media and not what it actually isSorry I didn’t mean labour as socialist. I meant labour and socialist parties. My ex was a socialist and very vocal probably why.Lana Bailey that’s a TERRIBLE reason. Do you have any actual reasons for disliking socialism. I feel that looking after the other more vulnerable people in your society would sound appealing to most. But it’s not 😔Sorry but it’s true he wasn’t a nice person. I’m sure there are socialist that are nice thoughNot here to start an argument lol just stating my political views which I never doLana Bailey  but you’ll vote greens who usually swing with labour like do you understand how it works or no 😂😂I know haha. Labour aren’t that bad! But yeah just voicing my odd political views being a far right greeny lolMatt Bell Yeah helping them with other people’s money.Isn't centrelink a kind of socialist thing? I mean I don't think people deserve to starve or live on the streets just because they've yet to find a jobLabor are not a socialist party. Neither are Labour from the UK"Wow, I thought my political knowledge was limited but this thread has raised alarm bells.  Kerry, it’s the nation’s money, yes it comes from the taxpayers, if you don’t like it then move to a tax free dictatorship like a lot of the midse east. A LOT of money goes to places that I don’t like (MPs bankroll or tax free religious institutions). But it is distributed as the elected government decides.  If you think that we should remove the welfare state you’re more stupid than you look. Imagine the crime rates and public heath statistics when disabled and out of work people can’t even pay for food. Regardless of who’s money, the fact that you don’t like people less fortunate than you are being looked after just goes to show what kind of person you are. I really hope you find yourself in a place of need and desperation and somebody cares for you out of the good of their heart. Maybe then you’ll understand something about caring for fellow humans. Because obviously you don’t have a clue.""Hey Lana, so what part of your views are right wing? I’m perplexed. You disliked socialism because and ex was vocal about it. But you’ve not stated once where your views stand so I’m thinking maybe it’s more identity politics.""Matt, I’m as perplexed as you but take a breather. No disrespect, but insulting someone’s intellect wont get very far. She said she didn’t want an argument when people were asking her simple questions, so you’re not gonna convince her anything like this."My political views aren’t really relevant"Lana Bailey socialism is essentially a system that focuses on equality. Socialism is an economic system where everyone in society collectively owns a share of the country’s resources. The government generally allocates these resources on behalf of the people dependent on the level of work each person completes. Labor, and liberal are not socialist parties. Both parties maintain a welfare system to ensure the lower socioeconomic classes are looked after. Whilst socialism sounds like a nice theory, in a practical context it hasn’t been effective. Socialism does not harness capitalism’s philosophy of “greed is good”. In fact it pretends greed doesn’t exist, which is naive and impractical. It doesn’t reward entrepreneurialism and it struggles to innovate like a capitalist economy. Capitalism isn’t perfect because it creates inequality, however it’s the most perfect imperfect system we have. That’s why both major parties impose higher taxes on higher income earners to redistribute to the poor. It’s not socialism, it’s just making sure everyone in society has access to basic necessities."Thanks Harry Featherby this makes a lot of sense and I stand by thinking similar to you.Harry Featherby thanks again for taking the time to comment. I am a student studying entrepreneurship and business and as much as I’d love a less capitalist society I see the pros and cons of the struggle of all involved. This is probably why I don’t talk much politics lol. Who knows but thanks again regardless :) have a good night@matt (sorry I couldn’t tag you too many matt bells lol) What is identify politics?

I hear a lot of people say this, with no alternative solution. NOTE: I say this as someone who has thought about and does support renewables, just not for the reason of make a difference. So Enlighten us rather than cheap throw away insults since Im getting this watermelon stuff in my feed.""Peter Ian if we continue doing nothing, of course nothing will change. Australia can make a difference by leading by example or even by not continuing to fall far behind everyone else in the world. For example, Australia has a very low percentage of renewable energy and a much lower percentage compared to many countries in the world including Chile, China, New Zealand, Kenya, Nepal, Finland, Portugal, Norway, Scotland and the list goes on. In addition, Australia has a high level of CO2 emissions per capita (look at www.iea.org) compared to other countries. We can even make a difference to our local environment by preventing/ reducing air pollution (which leads to a number of health problems) and reducing impact on our oceans and land ecosystems. In addition by acting on climate change, we work to stop the increase in droughts, floods and other natural disasters that have been troubling us in Australia 🙂 I hope you find this helpful"It won’t.Kerry McCracken what’s your reasoning and evidence?"Torey Rickerby or what about the liberal “I believe in climate change, but Australia is a small country and what we do won’t make a difference” 🙄🙄🙄"Would be funny if these 4 weren't 50.01% of the population after distribution of preferences.Would be funny if it wasn’t so scary and true 😞 🙂I resent being used in this ad without my permission!"You missed people who don’t want increases to debt, taxes and immigration."Bianca Robinson Judy Hewat nan is Dave except instead of investment properties she “upgrades” her house with a new fence and new roof 😂 bless her though ❤️Drives a hybrid car and thinks they are saving the environmentPatch Rudd I would but we've all blocked each other 😂Carly Mack moodTag all the Daves and Jamies and Doreens in your life. i dare u 😉"Oh wow, you just nailed most of South East Queensland.""So true, but you forgot that they all want to privatise the ABC!""Lewis Adams I was about to tag you in this, then saw you’d already commented.""As a Lewis, I object to this characterisation. 😝""Silvan Bluett doesn't ""Jamie"" and ""Lewis"" perfectly describe one of the higher ups in cadets. 😁"What's wrong with playing with stocks all the time?I went to school with a shitload of JamiesThe only people who vote green.

I vote based on evidence-based best policy that relies on experts whose whole career is based on researching solutions to our nations most pressing issues.""Callum Brian  Gees, I hope not! LOL... But I am totally hearing you!👍""...and not to forget Steve: - a bit over being handed a label (read: ridiculed) when they have serious concerns/questions about major policies - sick and tired of not getting straight answers - dismayed by infighting and pettiness - disgusted by politicians pulling their opposition down to make themselves look good, instead of coming up with good policy to make them stand out."Louisa Tran haha so trueNo legit pls show your dad. Let me know what he thinks hahahaQuinn On"Louisa Tran - actually , they are far from my character. I am more like this :""A refugee who was brought up in a low social economic area of western Sydney,  changed 6 schools between the age of 8-12 because no school could cater for non-speaking English refugees. Lived in housing commission until finishing Uni and worked to make enough money to invest in his own unit at the age of 22. Worked hard and now employs up to 100 people and contributing to the economy as opposed to leeching from the economy. Have always supported the libs since 18yo because they make the economy stronger than the rest. Not scared to stand up for hardworking people. Do not fear hard work like many.""Quinn On successful contributing members of society know Liberal is to way to vote. The envious and jealous vote Labor, and those with the IQ of a lump of brick vote Green"thanks Ross .

As I said previously everyone is entitled to vote the way they choose without people like you mocking them! By the use of 'we're' I'm assuming you're aligning yourself with either the greens or labor and as such notice that it appears to always be the far lefties that make personal attacks on anyone who doesn't agree with their thinking! Which in turn surprises me because you seem to think that everyone should be of the same opinion as yours which in itself is starting to sound like you feel no one else is entitled to an opinion that does not conform to your way thinking which in turn sounds like a very communist way of thinking! What makes the world great is that everyone thinks differently! Respect and learning from each other is the key to creating great things, closed minds lead to a dead society! You learn more from another who has very different ideas to yourself, try it sometime instead of mocking!"Oh I definitely want to learn things from the people who stole millions in funding from disabled Australians just so they could claim to have a surplus and be 'superior economic managers' while doubling national debt"Jason Groenveld Brainwashed by propaganda!

Thatcher said that about socialism in 1976 and at the time the pound was fixed so it was true, now that it’s floating less true. The problem with socialism is that you remove motive to work and therefore motive to grow your economy.

It ain't a Billion Euro - but it's everything I have.After a billion dollars was raised for Notre Dame in 24 hours I gave up on humanity.  Good Luck with the Climate Change stuff.  XWatched BBC's Climate change - the facts doco this morning. I am in tears. Such a terrifying thought that adults and the elite are killing our planet then have the audacity to reprimand the school strike kids for trying to ensure they have a future.Timmy Rhook  climate change is real. The man made global warming they’re having a melt down over isn’t. The climate always changing. And it’s actually getting cooler. That’s why they changed it from global warming to climate change to keep scaring morons like the people on these pages. Haha"Bryce Hollins They have different names because they’re different things. Global warming refers only to the rising temp of the Earth. Climate change includes warming & the side effects of said warming (melting glaciers, rising sea level etc). Global warming is a side effect of climate change."co2 levels have been higher in the past prior to humans. Please explain how this is man made. It’s not."Bryce Hollins yes, i am sure the scientists who both studied and discovered that the climate always changes and led to several Ice Ages before our time, and who also studied and discovered the way humans have caused harmful, man-made climate change, are all wrong and the people who seem to think we can take and take and take without any consequences are on the right track."Eithan Gabriel Birkmeyer yeah when the ozone layer didnt even exist.....Irrelevant comment....This planet is random chaos. This planet is a globe. This planet is affected by heavenly bodies.  This planet is full of plebs.Eithan Gabriel Birkmeyer - Humans ridding this planet of vast areas of trees probably exacerbates the situation."Climate change is a hoax, Sorry to be the one to inform you."Maxton Holmes because liberals are stupidAnthony Bordin i don't follow. Can you please spell it out?"If that's true why aren't innercity greenies moving to the bush and stockpiling food, water, guns and ammo?"12 years?? Said who? Government trying to find a new way to control the people and raise tax! Nope I’m fine where I am! 😂At least there is one person here with common senseNa just the international scientific community but I'm thinking that if someone like you with a PhD and regular practise would bring your new information about how this has always happened they'll listen. Because again you've got a PhD and do this everyday of your life for years."Most of the international scientific community wont say a damn word about it because anyone that does risks losing their job, being demonized or lose their funding. It's become a dogma, and anyone that questions the man made climate change story are destroyed. Makes you think if the climate change myth is so set in hard evidence and proof then it wouldn't matter if someone came forward to question it, but instead they are destroyed to send a message to any other person thinking of coming out against it. The science isn't settled like most want you to believe, and in fact there is next to zero evidence in favour for the man made climate change story."Thomas Barnwell 🤔"The climate does change yes. But there isn't one paper or study that correlates a rise in co2 with a rise in temperature. Not one study. Because it's not true. The man made climate change myth is a way for a massive centralisation of power, mass control of people and a great way to create new taxes to line the pockets of the few. If anything the planet is going to get colder over the next few decades. Every single 'prediction' that the IPCC has given us over the last 30 years with regards to man made climate change have been wrong, or just flat out haven't happened. Why are the greens not speaking out against 5G if they're so concerned? 5G needs mass removal of urban trees as wet leafs interfere with the signal. There is so much more I could go into, but I doesn't matter because reading a comment won't change people's minds about something they've been indoctrinated to believe since birth. Taking care of the environment and stopping plastic use and stopping pollution are noble causes that we need, but don't confuse that with climate change. The last time we had this much push and hysteria over the climate was in 2007-2008 just before the banks fell apart, distraction technique perhaps? Anyhow I'm sure I'll be here to comment 20 years from now when the climate hasn't fallen apart, commenting on how the planets climate isn't going to fall apart 😂"Start by consuming less red meat :)How are we meant o convince them to change if we are still sticking to the old ways?but that’s not the point our efforts and money we sink into it are not making any difference what so ever wouldn’t it be more logical to invest our money elsewhere ? And to be perfectly honestly I highly what we do would have any impact what so ever over countries like China and America that are making billions off the businesses that create the most emissions"Aaron Fuller  One way we can help, Aaron, is to stop the Adani coal mine which will produce coal to burn in India. I know it seems like an impossible task to stand up to global capitalism but I think it’s important to do the “right” thing. We have this beautiful planet to pass on to future generations and I want my great grandchildren to know that at least their great nana tried her best. And they will be able to check, you know!"Trish Machugh Australia has the best coal in the world for burning in terms of what is emitted. If the Adani mine doesn't go through India will purchase crappier coal from somewhere else which will result in even worse emissionsPrimo Mahlon  wow really that’s interesting I thought all coal was the same"Aaron Fuller see you learn something every day,"George Thomson  yeah bro the more you know the further you go 😂😂Aaron Fullerthe 16 biggest largest ships in the world can cause as much pollution as all the worlds cars. Go figure.  It’s gonna take more than renuable energy to solve this problemI read somewhere even if Australia completely cut its emissions it still wouldn’t matter globally because we contribute less then 1% of green house emissions so overall globally we are making no significant change to global emissions shouldn’t we be targeting the countries with the highest emissions to actually make some kind of difference ?"it's almost like estimates changed because our consumption has not slowed down at all. pretty crazy how time and a lack of action can cause things to get worse, huh!""The estimates should have equated for expenential growth in the first place, like I said these ""estimates"" don't take into consideration the variables, it's simple math."simple math? oh that's awesome. please share your working i'd love to see it.1 + 1 = climate change no realBig if true"""First it was 30 years now its 12 (Media speculation of scientific models doesn't quantify as fact), there is no scientific proof to back up any of this [Citation needed] (Also the IPCC would disagree for starters), it's built purely on speculative data without any thought put into the variables [Citation needed], we are definitely going through climate change which we may very well be accelerating (97% of climate scientists papers say we're the cause of excess warming but ok), but other then that there is no hard evidence [Citation needed], I did vote greens but not for that reason.""  2/10""Robin Steel this is clearly going over your heads, I'm not saying its simple math to determine the rate of climate change or 'global warming' I'm saying that equating for variables is simple math. And that is clearly something that these so called scientists you're getting your information from have failed to do, if they weren't able to factor in overpopulation when they came to the original conclusion that we had 30 years not to long ago, the mere fact they couldn't even do that proves they're incompetent so anything they say from here on out should be classed as heresay and nothing more. Again I'll say it one more time, we may very well be speeding up the process and we definitely are polluting the oceans which needs to stop, but saying that we have 12 years to completely undo our ways would only lead to anarchy and the results would probably end up worse as every nation fort for what little recourses they could use, would you like a nuclear winter or a few inches of extra water in 10 years? (which btw is impossibe, if we all abanded fossil fuels overnight the vast majority of first world countries populations would die of mass famine within a matter of months) there is a very explicit documentary on it, if I could remember the name I'd post the link right now but dig deep enough and you'll find it. To simplify, all that food you buy from the supermarket that helps contribute to these issues (yet somehow you believe you have any right to complain) can't get delivered from the farms without trucks, trucks need fossil fuels, the damn farmers need it to procure the vast amounts of water needed to grow the crops too, you think that is just magically comes to them and before you state the obvious not all crops can survive of merely rain water.""There is so many factors and variables at play, I won't pretend to know them all though I'm sure in your minds use have the answer to everything and you're right beyond a shadow of a doubt, anyone who disagrees with you or even adds a different perspective must be wrong right?""Just fyi, warming of over 2.7 degrees has a high likelihood to trigger a de-glaciation event that would see the majority of both the arctic and antarctic ice shelfs melt which would lead to over a 50 /meter/ sea level rise.  Business as ususal scenarios put us on trajectory for 4+ degrees. So no, it's not just ""a few extra inches"" of water.  And I'm really not going to get into the rest with you because you clearly don't understand the work that has gone in to produce climate models and policy recommendations OR the amount of money and time that vested interests have put in to obfuscate those efforts.""Fair enough, (although 50 metres in 10 years? I'd honestly like a link because that sounds a little exaggerated) still does not prove we are the cause. The planet has had much more drastic climate shifts in the past."Joshua Robson Having a different perspective to 97% of *all of science* probably makes you wrong yes.  https://xkcd.com/1732/"Hahahaha I asked for a legitimate link what is this garbage, it looks like a four year old wrote it, I'm done here, comment in 12 years and we'll see who was right. And you still haven't shown me proof that 97% of scientists believe we are the cause of global warming because that is false and you know it. I may be wrong but at least I'm not blatantly lying to try and make myself look right, good day sir you're no longer worth my time"Joshua Robson https://skepticalscience.com/argument.phphttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2017/may/03/is-the-climate-consensus-97-999-or-is-plate-tectonics-a-hoax"- 90- 99.9% of climate science papers provide evidence for anthropogenic drivers of climate change as we see it now, the most commonly referred statistic is 97% as that has come from the most widely publicized meta study on climate papers. The science con"https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg2/"Rusty Gammon well at least you're speaking in facts now, that I can respect, fair enough, but if these predictions are accurate what exactly would you propose we do about it? I don't see you making a difference by trying to sway my opinion."Joe Murphy"First it was 30 years now its 12, there is no scientific proof to back up any of this, it's built purely on speculative data without any thought put into the variables, we are definitely going through climate change which we may very well be accelerating, but other then that there is no hard evidence, I did vote greens but not for that reason."All for fixing climate change unfortunately greens do not help with that at all since they rather fix old burnt down churches and all.Stephen Dovey dont forget the coal power stations they are building aswell"We already export coal, enough to allow for current use and a phase-out to alternative sustainable sources.  Expanding coal mining in the basin is unacceptable environmentally,  creates only 1500 jobs and delays the creation of truly green industries to employ our youth.  China, India are both moving to solar and wind farms;  while admittedly still building coal power plants.  It’s time to introduce new ‘clean’ industries to meet the worlds energy needs; anything else is selling out the next generation."Someone get this man a trophyAlready have solar panels and an electric carCould do with a bit of warm weather so dont worry about itListening to greens discuss how to prevent man made climate change is like two flees arguing who owns the dog.Someone doesn't know how voting works.Fil Franek BAHAHA I surely don’t u silly foolWhat and waste my vote I would rather vote laborGod I hope so.I think war will devastate the planet  before climate change...What is climate change?Alexia Rasmussen One of the reasons why I don't wanna have kidsAmanda Poulter understood.Wow you're dumbPretty sure it is only five years at this point. :/11 years 8 monthsGeorge Thomson it sure will.

There’s that."Amy Wakley-Ahearn sorry where is he a scientist in all this.Amy Wakley-Ahearn where's his bachelor of climate science. Or meteorology. Or astrogeology. 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️>Masters of Health Science >”where is he a scientist”Australian Young Greens climate health?Sorry I'm really super confused... help me understand.Health science still means scientist you drip"You’re shifting the goal posts. Medicine is applied science. Health science is science. You wanted a party with scientists- they are one. Scientists understand how evidence works, how studies are conducted and reviewed. What consensus is. Are you a climate scientist Josh? I’m not. So I listen to those whose expertise outweighs mine."Amy Wakley-Ahearn so you have to be a scientist to understand scientific science stuff eh.Josh Williams isn’t that the point you were trying to make?No. My point is that you've named only one person in the whole party who is a scientist. That's it. And this page wants to throw shade at PH for not being a scientist.   So I dunno guys sounds a bit like a hypocritical argument eh.🤫🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️Intelligent people don't need to be experts to understand the sense in what the experts say and to trust them. The deniers are all thick fuckwits who should be sterilised.Bahaha juliar gillard had professor Tim Flannery and ten years ago he said ocean levels would rise 6 meters in ten years. THEY DIDN'T.  This leading climate scientist then proceeded to purchase 2 adjoining SEA SIDE PROPERTIES.  And you complete brain dead morons chose to believe these PAID scientists. WAKE UPPeter Maxwell 6 meters in ten years? No climate scientist would make such a drastic over -the-top claim. Are you sure he wasn’t being facetious?Skye Maxine Caulfield Tim Flannery said all the ice caps would have melted by 2018. That cities of Brisbane and Sydney would ruin out of water because it would no longer rain.   Seriously don't defend the likes of this overzealous grub.Josh Williams we have a transgender lesbian here in Skye Maxine Caulfield. So sad for you skye . You have an untreated mental illness and that is sad. If you're unsure of your gender please get a chromosome test or dna test as those 2 will never ever change no matter how you try. Your gender is assigned at birth."Josh Williams the Greens make their policies after consulting best scientific knowledge and advice from experts. If you are interested, you can join the greens and then join a policy working group to see how their policies are made. You don't need to be a scientist to listen to expert scientific advice. But giving your opinion on science when you're not a scientist is ridiculous."Peter Maxwell #DKE"I can name a few more with degrees in science.

At least we won't have to work because of the great third depression.yeah what ever they said the same thing back in 89 and what happened??????nothing.Peter Perfect Al Gore was not backed by almost complete consensus of the scientific community.And the award for the gayest comment on facebook goes to Luke"Dear Aussies,  We have twelve years to completely change the way we live on this planet.

So far I've been to 4 different countries and no sea level rises there. So where is this mysterious sea level rise ?Oh and furthermore Belle Needham seeing as you are a true believer can you tell me how we can control cyclones and earthquakes and floods and droughts please seeing as you are conceited and naive enough to think we can control the earths temperature like a big ole air conditioner."it’s risen about 20cm in the past 25 years, and the margin will only grow bigger and faster in the next century if something’s not done to change it. along with this thousands of animal species have become extinct within that time, along with countless natural disasters"Belle Needham omg you are a twit .ten years ago the true believers said the sea levels would rise metres. Fact is they have not risen at all. So please take your factless scare mongering elsewhere.  But feel free to answer my last question.  I guarantee you cannot."Peter Maxwell  so your implying that scientists are idiots? or “twits” as you like to say. they’ll be the ones calling you a twit when the world is covered by water and the worlds population is decreasing rapidly, your grandkids may well be in that population. climate change is not inevitable, do your research before you start calling people out for stating facts."Belle Needham only fact is you are wrong. Just like ten years ago the paid scientists were wrong. How can you be so conceited and naive to think you and all the other true believers can control earths temperature. If that were true then you and all the true believers can stop cyclones earthquakes ect.  FACT IS YOU CAN'T. How about juliars head climate scientist 10 years ago.  Ole Flim Flannery .he said sea levels would rise up to 6 meters and then proceeded to buy 2 sea side properties. Haha these scientists are on a payroll . WAKE UP"Peter Maxwell  i’m going to say it once more, do your research before you start calling people out for stating facts. FACT is, carbon emissions are heating up the planet rapidly, in FACT, 2018 was the 4th hottest year recorded in history. please have a look at this article if you care about our earth and the next generations future.  https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/""animal extinction is fake is it? temperature recordings that the ocean is heating up are fake are they? bushfires are fake are they? droughts are fake are they? they’re real and they are some of the biggest issues as a result of climate change, facts will always win :)))"Belle Needham sometimes not worth engaging with people who do nothing but resort to name calling when you oppose them 👌Danielle Schaeche very good point hahaBelle Needham Well done on staying calm and sticking to the facts though #climatechangeisrealFacts bahahahaha FACTS IS YOUR WRONG.And if the shoe fits. I will call an idiot a n idiotBelle Needham we have had droughts and bushfires and cooling and heating oceans long before humans were even here. How can you make such utterly ridiculous claims .you are a complete idiot. Facts.you wouldn't know a facts if it came up and bit you in the face. Wow how do you get dressed in the morning being so dumb.https://www.facebook.com/198600623557681/posts/2219389608145429/ not 1Belle Needham the only thing that is fake is Peter Maxwells profile.Nice deflection from your ocean of looneys . I get to enjoy every year seeing actual facts proving you looneys wrong."Peter Maxwell notice how i tagged a legitimate source, and you tagged a sketchy facebook post that you probably found on pauline hansons facebook 😂 oh and name calling won’t get you very far mate"Peter Maxwell your facts are taken from someone who didn’t finish high school. Good luck with that.And your paid scientists are so so believable. Well in the past 10 years non of the utter rubbish has happened.none of it. As for name calling if the shoe fits. I say lace it up .you see idiotic comments can only be made by an idiot. You have been brainwashed  sadly .but lets wait another 10 years and i can laugh at your stupidity even harder.Peter Maxwell trolling sites with a fake profile is intelligent then? I think not. All the best muffin man.No fake.im as real as the person i was 11 years ago when i joined fb. But nice deflection there from reality. I shouldn't expect anymore from green socialists voters .each election the fog rises and voters wake up to how dangerous the greens idealogy truly is.If man made climate change is real then why 10years ago when the true believers said in ten years time the sea levels would rise due to all the ice melting and it didn't.

The liberals are a great party economically. If it wasn’t for their dehumanisation of any person who is not straight, white, a man, and wealthy, I would vote for them. Malcom was extremely business savvy and had some very progressive social ideals which lost him the trust of his party and subsequently got him ejected. Following, he began making light of the LNP’s and the ALP’s social politics through cunning sabotage which has contributed to the surge of young Australian’s enrolling to vote.""I think this decision from Malc may have been more intentional than he is given credit for. I don’t think he was too much of a fan of the Libs - he originated in opposition against Howard. Following his ejection, he has continued to sabotage the libs rep. A green at heart, that one."Jarmohn Lloyd out here bleedin greennature runs through my veinsConnor Howes"That vote was akin to every person in the country being entitled to observe you in your own home, doing things that only effect you, decide that they don't like something that has nothing to do with them and think that free speech entitles them to be able to opress you by law... and then thinking that they have done the right thing.  People think their right to an opinion is the right to oppress others with it.""I’d agree, though I think it not as conscious a thing as your sentiment implies.  Still that’s the problem with all of our laws.  I’m glad we have mechanisms to change them.""Ah yes, the matter of conscience, where the large majority of people are asked to vote on what rights minorities should be allowed.""The horror is that overall, that was a vast improvement on the origins of the process, where typically, a bunch of people would have to martyr themselves, like seriously get dead, so a small oligarchy like The House of Lords, could cede those rights posthumously.  So, yay for a mechanism that doesn’t quite run on human sacrifice anymore, boo for it being others defining your freedoms.  Bittersweet stuff, got to avoid being owned by the bitterness.""""it could be worse"" is a pretty lame arguement when we have the potential, means and opportunity to do better.""There are so many people putting shade on 18th and 19th Century folks for not having 21st Century values that we forget how amazing some of their changes were.  I'd never say 'it could be worse'.  I'm just not sure how you get rights without needing them to be ratified into law.  I can say 'Computer access should be a right', but until there's consensus, it doesn't magically become one.""I think Malcolm had principles that were common to most people who like democracy.  The vote was a matter of conscience, and said, yay, we have one.  So, lots of people in other parties aren’t monsters just because they have a different view."Voting for a cleaner environment 🖤💛❤️Alex Lease hahahahahLove 😂Sophie Cubit-Jones 😂HahahaJess Holliday 😂😂Catherine Larkin 👶🏻💪LOLI think there's too many reasons to list on the bottom text...Cale Hill 😂Daniel Piggott amazingHolly Robinson Lauren Anne AHHAHAwhere can I find the stats?"This is a pretty dumb meme.. 😂 what even, leftists can’t meme.. check out Young Conservatives Queensland for the dankest memes"😂Greta Schipp I won’t stop ahahai’m deceasedOmg Emmerson LucyOof Claudia CramondShannyn van Heerden omwFinley Angus nah I haven’t enrolledWoodley Angus you’re too young you idiotFinley Angus and I won’tRyley Angus Mar Ley Macca Angus Woodley Angus they done played themselvesToby Heiniger love it!Fiona Newton this made me chuckleAj Scarcella gooooooodGeorgia Thacker HaMika Kemp Charlie Scottcharlie Emily Bollandemily lmaoooLia Vassiliadis ded Shania Khan Scooter James Axeris SondyreTjana Kimberly ayyeeThank you so much to everyone who enrolled this time around 💚 let’s do thisEmily 😂😂😂Ded Emily HoedtKristina Page :0Liliena Jovic-Peu :000000Andrew GrettonThe left can't memeKalina Ashley I think it’s got a lot to do with the fact we’re all broke and can’t afford the fine but go usThank goodness 🖤💛❤️My dads nearly 50 and he's never voted and never plans too.

CLEANER, QUIETER, CHEAPER, ELECTRIC VEHICLES!   We all know that once a person drives an electric vehicle, driving anything else is like driving the Flintstones car.  What's URGENTLY needed is for everyone to unite and form an organised group offering drives (or at least rides) in electric vehicles in ALL marginal electorates before the Australian federal election so that people who are currently unsure or afraid of change can have this experience! In much the same way that the Tesla owners decided to create a charging network themselves, all electric vehicle owners RIGHT NOW have the power to cause a positive outcome at this election,  to ensure the more rapid uptake of electric vehicles powered by renewables.  ELECTRIC PEOPLE POWER!   　    It requires urgent organised action  ASAP!  Just like the school strikes, we need people to organise this and just do it!

So to the all the silly people participating in this silly rally, get in your car and go home because, you won’t stop Adani from burning the coal and emitting greenhouse gases,  the only thing that you have achieved is burning more fossil fuels by driving around in your car!

It is no longer relevant. It specifically talks about their coal power stations, which are being closed."I did.  It is still relevant.  I have seen no data to suggest this trend is reversing."Yup, cause after they close down all their coal power stations, they are still going to offset their renewables using coal power stations...""Right. In 2018, Germany cut their carbon emissions by about 5%, but that had little to do with renewables or significantly reducing the use of coal. It had more to do with being a warm year (ironically), and greater use of nuclear power.  I have to say that this is a fascinating subject to look into in detail. The complexity is mindboggling, and simply stating we need to switch to renewables is not going  to solve anything. There are lots of problems with renewables that still need to be ironed out. Hope they can find a solution, but i think the public debate is overly simplistic, to say the least.""Germany, the renewable success story of the world...… yet their carbon emissions have not declined.  They will need to solve the problem of storage for renewable energy, and that might take some time yet.  https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesconca/2017/10/10/why-arent-renewables-decreasing-germanys-carbon-emissions/"yeah right come out past the inner city and come with me and see how long your electric car will last in the bull dust??????"Many have a range over 500 km, Tesla truck has a range over 800 km. Rapid charge over 80% in 15 minutes. Most people don't travel over 160 km in one trip on average. You can always choke on the smog from your puffed up truck Patrick, which costs more than 4 times as much to run in fuel, and has 2000 moving parts instead of less than 20, leading to many more maintenance issues. 😎😎""Replace all ICE cars, trucks, and buses with electric. I have been riding an electric motorbike for almost 5 years and it is much cheaper to run and maintain than a gas guzzling Toorak Tractor. Coal fired power stations need to be replaced by solar, wind, hydro with 1440 Degrees type of molten silicon storage for heat (Northern Hemisphere Winters) and power generation (heat --> steam or other generator from molten silicon storage). Thorium sub critical nuclear reactors could also be used that are much safer and can incinerate regular spent nuclear fuel waste. We could have had Thorium sub critical nuclear power in the 1950's instead of dangerous uranium fueled critical reactors, but USA wanted to divert plutonium into nuclear bombs. We could have had an electric car industry over 120 years ago, but cheap oil from Texas made sure that didn't happen. The electric cars of the time (late 1890's) were much faster (70kmh) and didn't pollute the air !!! It is about time we reversed these really bad decisions from decades past. #ElectricMotorbikesRule #TeslaRules #BYDRules #SavethePlanet"Jimmy James coal is the end of our planet"Allegra Mingonie Coal is just a mineral in the ground, greedy and unethical politicians and board members are the end to our planet"Jimmy James and coal is one of their greatest weapons to achieve it.Looks like my initial sarcasm need some picturesJimmy James It registered with some of us 😊If we don't dig up the coal and burn it the mole people win."It can't be done, it must be witch craft! Coal is the future"Veronica Louise 💪🏼 so proud of GermanyAdriane KnoblauchHave you watched Pandora's Promise? The argument they make is that the real proponents of renewables are oil and gas companies because eventually you still need reliable sources.Jeremiah Hunter no I haven’t. Makes sense. Every grid that relies on renewables is hugely backed up by fossil fuels as batteries aren’t viable. Will watch!Michael Sutton And this guy didn't even touch on the human atrocities and deaths involved in how we get most of our elements for our batteries and solar panels.https://youtu.be/N-yALPEpV4wlang lebe Deutschland😍Bridie Rann we ❤️ germanyIT'S A SHOT OF A COAL PLANT.

The animal that was stunned displayed high readings for minutes after being stunned, where the animal that had it's throat slit died within a second"I'll also point out not all animals are stunned either. Some are electrocuted to deathStunning animals has proven to be more painful and distressing for the animal than just slitting it's throat. But they don't kick around and it appears less stressful to people so we continue to do itImagine being that insecure."Rose Davis  and air, sadly."Rose Davis and fruit and veges 🤣Petrol for his car"Mean while, bet he has Halal water, coffee, milk and bread in his home"I prefer the solid ones to smack on senators heads.. you know the brick sized ones?

Hahahah! 😭😭""Aidan they retroactively lowered the threshold for everyone recently, who's to say they won't do it again? https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/jun/28/student-debt-how-the-governments-hecs-changes-will-affect-you"But the repayment rates at those lower thresholds are tiny."Aidan Templeton you begin paying HECS back at around $47,000 earned a year. But they take payments out based on your weekly or fortnightly payments and how much you would earn a year based off that fortnight or week. So if you take extra shifts/work overtime you end up paying more in that fortnight/week's payment than other weeks.  It's ridiculous that young people should have to pay tens-hundreds of thousands of dollars to become an engineer, a nurse, a doctor, a teacher etc etc  These are investments into the future. Don't punish the youngest souls for being born.""Tynika Campbell   Well that seems self explanatory. If you work extra shifts or overtime, your income is higher and therefore you can repay more. Why wouldn’t you want to repay your debts sooner if your income is higher? You’re a fool not to.   It costs that much money legitimately to acquire teaching resources, pay all staff on a university and accredit and audit the university appropriately. In addition, because right now HECS (because there’s no guarantee of repayment ever being made which costs tens of millions of dollars for universities annually) is such a risky investment, they have to charge higher prices to cover their losses. This is also why universities preference enrolling foreign students over locals, because they are more likely to get their money back that they spent teaching you.   They’re not being punished for being born, or even punished at all. They are being held accountable to undertaking the serious commitment that tertiary education should be and ensuring that students who don’t properly devote themselves to the commitments they made are held accountable, and that the investment pays off. If universities keep making losses because students don’t repay their loans in due time, they will have to continue to raise costs as they have, or they will have to close down and then nobody gets educated.  But you refuse to understand how economics and finance actually works, which sucks because that stuff is simple and really should be taught in compulsory public schooling but sadly isn’t.""Aidan Templeton I hate the idea of paying my HECS back one day but damn you’ve got a point. We all get 13 years of free schooling and if we add up the cost we can’t say we don’t get our fair share now can we. Especially when not everyone needs tertiary education. Yes helpful but not always necessary so if you need it you pay it and hope to god you’re good enough at your job, that repaying your hecs doesn’t send you broke.""Ashley White   You really don't have to worry. Repaying your HECS will never send you broke because the initial repayment amounts are small. HECS is specifically designed so that you don't begin repayments until you can afford them, and after $42000 p.a ($807 a week) you'll only be repaying about $8.10 a week (about 1%) which is very little in comparison now that you put it into perspective. Then when you gain higher income, your repayments will increase, but you also are able to afford the increased repayments because of your higher income - which is also good because the fees are repaid faster and you have that debt out of your hair earlier in life. Finally, there is also no interest on your repayments either!  That's the beauty of the system that Labor devised and it works wonders. All the people and Greens party members freaking out about the repayments really are just sensationalising the issue and don't understand how little it actually will effect you."Yeah look it's cool and all until they government under-taxes you on your HELP debt and all of a sudden you owe 3k at tax time. That did send me broke.Georgi McLaren   That could happen with any significant long term investment. Always good to have a good accountant or tax agent you know on standby to disputes the claims and to verify everything adds up. You only need them once in a blue moon and they aren’t all that expensive to hire once you’re in the realm of income for repaying HECS.But you don’t have to repay HECS until you can afford it?Nathan!!!!!!!would be lovelyTaela Luckins Caitlin Pryce would love no hecs thank youEach paycheck when we get a job hahahEllie Scafidi Erin Atkins Hollie Munro Zoe Ellen Georgia RyanWould love it if uni was free.....Gabby Clarke life’s hardhahahhaha Sarah ElizabethI cry everytime 😪‘And that’s why I’m voting one nation’ 😂Jai Ridler ooooofEmily Durante HahahahahahMatthew 😂😂Alana Laura 😂😂Jane Eller Lauren Hunt Morgan Butler Jessie Martinez Beatrice Hathaway Lucy JuhnkeLala Rose 😂😂Bianca Janssen lyfaint that the truth.Alex Rolfe Anna Rolfe HAHAHAHAHAHAHehe Kristian Petroski"Lucy Macdonald *70,000?"Charlotte Garner 😡😡😡Grace Sinstead-Reid Jarrad SalmonBrittany Hickey I've manipulated mine so it's only 35kElena Butterfield Jesmond Connolly BorgGrace McKell a 'haha' but also a 'cry'Samantha Adriana Tahlee Johnson Tessa HillDallan Walsh 😭😭😭😂😂😂Rhyannon Dixon 😂😂Sian Bradley Zuzia Juszczynska :'(Jaymes Dibley 😞Jewels Bulger *100kBeatrix Hardy hahahahLol Annie HoadAnais Stephens 😍Tegan McGirr i wanna love because i feel so strongly but also don’t wanna send the wrong messageHeather-Belle McGirrJaylah Jonesright in the feelsInnes McDiarmidChester NavalesStef Rixon so true and love that it’s cat in the hat 😂😍Jade Rapp legit one of the reasons I tagged you 😂😂Jade RappNosh Lapaz 😭😭Sam PikeJohn SomersEbony Pritchard ):Yasmeene TurkilsenBrayden Grant Joshua PearsonCharli Philips attackedRebecca JovanovicNikita Nutley I love cat in the hat memesHeather FullerKimberly SmithReilly O'Hagan  I could rant so much rnPoppy Tidswell honestly same I could cryPoppy TidswellJordan Sandwell omg love it 😂Makayla McKeeCj sad that the greens kinda wackJackOlivia Langfield m8 feel like you’re past $40 000Samantha LangfieldTom DownieEmma WalshRhian Niamh Woolley"Matthew Klaassen $40,000 that's cute 😂"Rheanna KlaassenJayden Coleman ayI completely forgot to enrolI did it just thenGood job I'm so proud ❤️Thank you for saving my lifeYou're most welcome bbySarah CrockerTayler Deighton more like $65-70k though?

Di Natale says if Labor’s climate policy, post-election, meets the Greens’ test of ambition, and one of the relevant tests of ambition is “a plan to phase out coal”, then Shorten can expect support.  “But if it’s going to lock in failure, then we won’t support it. We will make a decision based on the policy.”""  What part of this scares you?"The part where he says he is willing to vote against Labor's climate policy if it doesn't suit all their demands"I dont think its unrealistic or demanding to want a plan to phase out coal, or a desire to stop the Adani project. Besides, that whole article is saying ""the way our government and democracy works sucks because the greens can stop 'progress'"". If the policy is, as Di Natale says, going to lock in failure, then it won't be supported, it'll be voted against, revised, and improved.   The primary argument here seems to be 'Di Natale is utilising democracy to form policy'....""A policy isn't going to ""lock in"" failure though. I'm 100% for stopping Adani and phasing in renewables but it's been 10 YEARS since the last bill was stopped by the Greens. Something a lot of people seem to be ignoring is the fact that once it is passed, a bill can always be revised and changes can be made to it. Why not pass a ""less extreme"" bill now and then push to have it revised in the future. I think that to say you refuse to budge on anything but the ideal bill right here and now is to not have the environment at the core of your concern. Because action needs to be taken right now and anything is better than the Coalition's envioronment and climate policy!! :)""That sounds like you're suggesting that the Greens party doesn't have the environment at the core of their concern..  Just think about that for a second. ""The Greens party does not have the environment at the core of their concern""."You're asking the Greens party to 'just shut up and agree so that way at least something happens'. So the Greens should agree to a bill that has no plan to phase out coal? They should agree to a plan that includes Adani? Why? Because Labor pinky promises that they'll revise it maybe?lmao you do know that the Greens can propose an amendment to Labor's bill too right?"that amendment still has to be voted on though, so why wouldn't they just say no in the first place until policy actually makes sense""Because in the interim, Labor's policy would be an overhaul to the current EPA thus providing much greater environmental protection than the legislation that currently exists, especially with Berejiklian now abolishing the NSW Environment Office. What a loser.""That's a fair statement, plus yeah, I'm all about throwing shade to Berejiklian. But that's more reason, if Labor does care about the environment, for them to propose something realistic yet ambitious. Di Natale isn't going to block policy in effort to delay action on environmental issues, he's going to vote for policy that is evidence-based.""Aurora Ihalainen James Wilson oh, okay then"Tea for two Shamila KumaraKris Rendevski hahah your manBailey J Maher wot doinRyan Stevenson he’s not wrongAlex Newton exactlyAsh Carter lmaooooAnna Huynh niceShould chuck that on his billboards insteadBrendan Wood classicAlex Marshall solid logicRub Yklimek 👌🏻Kim Eldridge show dadhe's playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers.

Sam Hibbins, the Greens MP for Prahran increased the Greens vs Liberals 2 candidate  preferred by over 8% compared with the federal election 2016 vote in the booths in the state seat of Prahran that fall within Higgins at last years state election, too. Sam got 59.13% across the 2/3rds of the Prahran electorate that overlaps with the new boundaries of Higgins, and this against Katie Allen, the current Liberal candidate (who also ran for the Liberals in Prahran & whose primary vote fell by over 10%). I got robopolled by Kelly O’Dwyer 18 months ago  (the actually announcement said it was from Kelly’s office) about local issues and who I would vote for.  That just doesn’t happen in safe seats.  I’ve been regular getting robopolled about voting intentions  for the last 2 years.  Higgins is now totally in play & I am looking forward to voting for Jason and for him being my next local MP.""Patrick Hayton No way on Earth Libs hold that seat, especially with recent redrawing boundaries.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me."" ~  pastor Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) ~ The Rise of Nazism""A federal politician threatening to dox a fellow senator, what the actual fuck?"That is exactly what happened."Neil Spurgeon we all walked in to it thinking Malcom would be meme worthy, it takes quite a disgusting person to top that."James McGrath was despicable. His puerile ranting made Malcolm Roberts look reasonable.. and that aint easy!"Madonna Rae   He didn’t threaten her.   That is not what he said, the quote is this:  “Let them go to your house. What's your address? Put your address out there and let the farmers go to your house. That's what's happened to farmers. That's what's happened to farmers .... that have had these monsters, these eco-criminals invade their homes. Shame on you for defending them.”  In other words, he’s saying Larissa Waters is a hypocrite for standing up for the recent militant vegans carrying out home invasions, thefts and violence in the name of their ideology in recent week’s memories, because he’s implying she wouldn’t be willing to have her address out there (the various Vegan activist networks publish addresses of farmers online to encourage attacks) to face the same thing.  That is not the same as saying, “I’m going to publish your address online for home invaders.” If he was doing the latter, it would actually be a threat. He’s calling her a hypocrite and highlighting her logic, not threatening her."Aidan Templeton sounds threatening from my point of view but then hey each to their own."Madonna Rae   Then your point of view is warped and extremely overly sensitive or paranoid if you take that as a threat. A threat is saying you’re going to do something, not saying that you should put yourself in somebody else’s shoes.""Love to you, hope you feel better soon."No more!Aidan Templeton actually she said the protesters went too far"Tanya Louise   She may have, I’m just stating what it is obvious McGrath actually meant."Aidan Templeton  interesting interpretation of threatening. ON voter maybe?"Carrol and Madonna, I know I'm also a bloke so it will be easy to dismiss my opinion on this, but I have to say, I'm a greens voter, and a massive supporter of gender equality, and fairly well educated on issues about respecting women and reducing violence against women, but I even I have to admit, I'm with Aidan on this one I'm afraid. McGrath is a scumbag, but it was 100% clear in the context of the conversation that his intent was a ""how would YOU like it"" comment and not a threat. Was it a nice thing to say? Absolutely not. Did he at any point, imply he was going to publish her address though? No. He literally said SHE should put her OWN address out there to experience what it's like. It's actually pretty different. There were about 1,000 things McGrath did wrong in that interview, i'm just not sure this was one of them, and unfortunately, when the Greens jump all over this with their graphic, all it does is make it easy for the other side to question their credibility which I'm disappointed about."Sputnik Sputnik  I think if you were a woman living all your life with little innuendos of harm if you step out of the box or dare to challenge then you too would have received his comments as a threat. You may never see it this way and that’s good. If we were all threatened constantly we would be a very sad country. Hugs🤗 Glad your already seeing that the Greens are the party for a future that is bright."Carrol Putland   Nope, I hate One Nation and their xenophobic ways, and oppose the way they wish to indoctrinate kids in schools in the name of Nationalism and the idiocy they propose economically called Protectionism. I just understand how language works and am not a Snowflake who thinks anything mean is a threat and crumbles apart instantly. I actually vote for the Liberal Democratic Party.""Madonna Rae   Funny, because I’ve asked women and spoken to them about this and they said the same thing as me. This literally has nothing to do with gender, throw that assumptive and sexist trash talk out the window. It’s not a threat because it literally doesn’t meet the definition of a threat, which is implying that you will do something negatively to them. He said she she do it to herself, not that he will do it to her. That’s not a threat, that’s telling somebody to put themselves in somebody else’s shoes."Yes that was appalling. Very telling.A man threatening a woman’s safe place.... say no more.Put him in a pig pen and let the pigs free.You should have an image of McGrath on here in full rage mode to show him in all his glory 😏 He was an utter disgrace last night!!Well Nambour is a very small township. Would be easy to find out what his address is as well.Tanya MacRae and women who hate men"True, although it wasn't a threat. McGrath is garbage but this was still deliberately misrepresented."Tim Vollaroo Go away."Keep you head in the sand there, Pat.""And apparently for extreme ""activists"" giving vegans a bad name""Doxxing. The weapon of choice for cyber bullies, trolls, and men who hate women."Should be sacked and gaoled for inciting violence"Pariss Elizabeth If it is not, Australia is really fucking weird for a democratic country."theres no actual law against doxxing but it may fall as an offence under the telecommunications actJamie Fitzgerald inviting people to invade her home on television though?Pariss Elizabeth there are still no laws for it  doxxing is a relatively new thingIt wasn't even a threat. This was deliberately misrepresented.  He's still garbage of course.Tim Vollaroo how did you perceive it?"Incite to violence is an offence. Doxxing isn't (yet) illegal, but that wouldn't matter."It was loud stupid rhetoric. Literally a rhetorical question."For those of you saying ""doxxing is not illegal"" that is, at least in Canada, where I am from, only TECHNICALLY true.  Take this for example: Jealous husband comes to my place of work, asking for his ex wife's address.  I don't like Karen, so I give him the address.  Jealous husband goes and murders Karen.  Police find out through numerous witnesses that I provided her personal information to the murderer.  How much do you want to bet that I am going to prison as an accessory to murder?  It's pretty easy money.""Pariss Elizabeth   He didn’t threaten her. This has been deliberately misrepresented by The Greens, making them just as bad and hypocrites.   That is not what he said, the quote is this:  “Let them go to your house. What's your address? Put your address out there and let the farmers go to your house. That's what's happened to farmers. That's what's happened to farmers .... that have had these monsters, these eco-criminals invade their homes. Shame on you for defending them.”  In other words, he’s saying Larissa Waters is a hypocrite for standing up for the recent militant vegans carrying out home invasions, thefts and violence in the name of their ideology in recent week’s memories, because he’s implying she wouldn’t be willing to have her address out there (the various Vegan activist networks publish addresses of farmers online to encourage attacks) to face the same thing.  That is not the same as saying, “I’m going to publish your address online for home invaders.” If he was doing the latter, it would actually be a threat. He’s calling her a hypocrite and highlighting her logic, not threatening her.""Aidan Templeton thank you. And I agree, he's definitely still garbage but people who are shocked that he brought it up should also have a hard look at what their view on the ""activists"" giving vegans a bad name, actually doing just that is."I would have been very threatened by that.Isn’t this literally a crime?"Alright Larissa, get the police involved. Show him he can't do this and get away with it.""That’s fucking disgusting! I don’t care how much you hate your political opponents, you never threaten them with violence! 🤬"Quite so. But it's hard to tell when someone is yelling when an inside voice is more than adequate. They had electric microphones and everything.Shaun Blue she said the protesters went too far but apparently she didn't condemn their actions firmly enough for his likingHow is that not illegal? On TV no less? Wtaf?"Macca Straede but sadly, they'll still get the support of the die hard right who see no issue in their behaviour..."Harry Lavers let's hope they are a minority.The lnp and one nation members really didn't do themselves or parties any favours with the way they carried on last night.Harry Lavers he was so out of it he assumed that of you were from the greens you were vegan. Also when asked about racism and being photographed with young men with racist symbols. He said he didn’t know then he proceeded to muddle race with ethnicityAnd talking over her all night...  He is an absolute piece of work..."Liam Madashell exactly what went through my mind ""is this the style of politics taught in our universities""? Heaven help us as a democracy!"Heather Pow   It’s the style of the modern political debate from both left and right.He never really grew out of his bully tactics from his uni days..."This is disgusting. It has actually happened to me, published on a Facebook group with over 10,000 members. It is called 'doxxing'. It is terrifying. It makes you feel unsafe in your own home. It is likely to be a criminal offence under s 474.17 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. Sadly the Queensland Police aren't interested, although if it is a Senator they might get interested.""I think that's the key point. If he was just making some ""how would you like it if people came into your home?"" point it would be one thing, but it was AFTER she specifically said she didn't support that kind of protest, and the tone was super aggressive and threatening."She has young children. Absolutely vile. After she said she doesn't support anyone going into someone's home.James McGrath made Malcolm Robert's look good  Which is something I never thought would ever be said"Annette Hearne she was getting spoken over constantly by the two blokes... It was shameful, disgusting behaviour on their part."Annette another way of looking at it is that she let a lot of things ride and in the process gave a few of them a lot of rope to hang themselves with.Mandy Field   Sounds like my marriage and half the debates or arguments I’ve had with women though. 🤷‍♀️"Virginia Trioli contributed to the unruly behaviour through her own actions, talking over one of her guests while they were trying to answer a question.  I wonder if she lets her son stand up to pee yet?""I turned it off. Too shouty, too nasty, disappointed that moderator seemed unable to manage it. Nothing positive in this setting.""Not surprised anymore, these jerks are scrambling for high ground but their rusty old ship is about to sink"What the actual fuck. That is inciting lawbreaking and potentially violence. What a cock head. Larissa must be doing something right.Beat you he’s against people going onto farms but!Virginia Trioli couldn't do her job to control the discussion - and indeed inflamed the situation with her own behaviour; excruciating to watchHe wouldn't shut up I couldn't watch it to the end urghI hope security dragged him out of the building!We need to get these horrid personalities out of politics. #Grrrrrrrrruhhh since when did the Greens do that?they didn't. brett is a liarBrett Herbert What?!Brett Herbert not so. Anyway take a drive you will be able to recognise a farm.      Just like all sides of politics some are and some not vegansBrett Herbert not the greens matey - a particular group of vegan activists. Nothing to do with the GreensJust like the greens publishing people’s farm addresses?There is a big difference between property trespass and a home invasion.Anthony Henderson sadly there will be many out there who consider such behaviour to mean he is strong and confidenttoo true. So many have no idea. Maybe they are used to being bulliedMcGrath's performance last night was appalling. Interrupting and talking over everyone else. Stop voting for these idiots people!"Well the thing is, he isnt"How is he allowed to do this!! We need to offer her protection!Yes that's what I thought PetrosThat’s not what he said.Can anyone post the time stamp on the iview recording please?Belinda Marriage what has that got to do with it? 🤦🏼‍♂️Challis David Barnes if you cant make the connection you are part of the problem"There is a HUGE difference between trespassing on someone's property without intent to harm someone, and home invasion with potential intent to harm someone. The two aren't comparable in this topic."^^ this guy knows what’s up"Jesse Sales there is intent to harm - do you know the mental aguish farmers and their children have been going through?  Fear of being broken into, having diseases bought onto their farms and having their animals stolen?  that is a home invasion - that is intent to harm""You are describing the impact upon the families being trespassed against. It is absolutely a serious matter, I'm not saying it isn't. Home invasion on the other hand, is an instantaneous matter of life and death."Jesse Sales it is home invasion - farms are peoples homes - difference here is that farms would have the security that Clarissa most likely has - or the same protection under current lawsKinda what is happening to farmers isn’t it?its on iview"I meant something more useful, like a timecode, or a direct link?""55:15 on the iView video, on the question about vegan activism."Thomas Coyne CheersKarl Ashley about 5min before the end.  https://www.abc.net.au/qanda/podcast/2019-15-04/10988970"Daniel Endicott Cheers, I saw the time code above and found it already, but having a direct link is good for anyone else who wants to see it. Memes are all well and good, but they don't do anyone any help if they want to know what *actually* happened."Karl Ashley yeah the context is a question about whether Greens support vegan protests and farm intrusions. McGrath basically lost all control.Karl Ashley   https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/6054070/qa-recap-james-mcgraths-one-way-trip-to-crazy-town/"Aidan Templeton I already watched the clip. Though, for the record, what you linked is not a source. Its better than the original meme posting, but its still not a source."Karl Ashley  Roberts did try to be courteous but mcgrath embarrassing"Can someone provide an actual source for this, other than a screengrab of a tweet?"I certainly would not vote for him!! Not a good look he was very rudely interrupting!!"I was planning to watch it then I seen they had Malcolm Roberts on, I'm sick of news shows giving Pauline and her ilk a platform, wasn't in the mood for it last night. Never even heard of James McGrath.""Makes you feel for farmers though, yeah?"That is so so sooo unacceptable and disgusting!!!!! We love you Larissa!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️"Typical LNP, using below the belt tactics."Jonah Oliver https://youtu.be/eiQcvf4qj1Ethank youJonah Oliver Can anyone post the time stamp on the point where he says this please?Yeah I’m watching now and will let you know when it comes upJonah Oliver he was out of line throughoutDoes anyone have a link to this video?"Wayne Camilleri  no, though inciting violence is"another case of the law not keeping up with technologyIsn't doxing illegal ?Wtf ... Didn't this country and the pollies just jump up and down over the unlawful actions of those vegan protesters ? One law for us and another for Government workers/pollies!!Cmon greens... that not what he said... please report the truth not what you want ppl to hear... damnLarissa looks ill and so she should. How despicable McGrath is.He was just disgusting throughout the entire show....What the actual fuckhttps://pacific.epeak.in/2019/04/15/qa-james-mcgrath-furious-at-everything-silent-on-alleged-adani-threat-australia-news/Sean Christensen  do not understand your comment. Mcgrath is as RIght wing as you can getSean's a bit off the planet.Sean Christensen it’s ok. They will work it out....eventuallyLying AND hypocrisy. Just another day in the life of the left-leaning.He’s awful.Spot on."That is not what he said, the quote is this:  “Let them go to your house. What's your address? Put your address out there and let the farmers go to your house. That's what's happened to farmers. That's what's happened to farmers .... that have had these monsters, these eco-criminals invade their homes.

I am all for debate but a majority of McGrath's comments were arrogant and divisive. As pointed out already, he made Malcolm Roberts look fair and reasonable!"Do the same to him  What a low life excuse for a manLoud-mouthed bullying thug."Honestly the word ""grub"" seems so bafflingly weak and cutesy. thats not grubby, thats dangerous. That malicious and reckless. Its vindictive and aggressive. Grubs are just dirtily little slimy animals. This is the kind of villainy that can only be encompassed in human terms. McGrath is A Villain. A Thug. He should not be in politics. He should be in remand."Rowan Thompson haha 🙃Callum HornsbyQ&A on ABC last night.

McGrath was a complete arsehole. End of story.Can we do another call/petition to remove this guy from parliament?  #creepyoldasshole"James McGrath is yet another disgusting LNP lowlife, no surprises by his behaviour and bully threats, just more disgust as they still manage to lower the bar to even further depths of depravity. If Larissa Waters home address does appear on the internet then lets hope the AFP do their job and arrest this scumbag for encouraging violence. IMO""I'm a greens voter, and I love almost everything you do, but I'm not sure this graphic is you at your finest. It's you doing what the others do, and I expect better of you. This is a twisted truth at best, and anyone who watched the actual thing knows it. McGrath is a nasty piece of work, and very unlikable, but I have to say, I don't think he threatened to publish her home address at all, did he? His quote was ""What’s your address? Put your address out there and let the farmers go to your house. That’s what’s happened to farmers. That’s what’s happened to farmers that have had these monsters, these eco-criminals invade their homes. Shame on you for defending them.”  At no point that I can see did he threaten that HE would publish her home address. Although if you have a different transcript to what I've seen, by all means publish it and I'll stand corrected.""Selena DL yuck, what a disgusting human"She nit a vegen terristthe man is a coward like most libs his day will come and he will get his lumps.Pretty sure doxxing is criminal.

You mean like not make any assumptions based on someone’s appearance!? That’s ridiculous! 😅Radical idea Scott - how about you just say ‘hello’? 🤔"In this case, a simple ‘hello’ would do the job"Showboating is probably his aim   ;)"Darlene Balaam, without doubt. Who gives himself a nick name, for example?""It’s funny, I’m sure in his head he thinks he’s reaching out and being friendly. I guess it’s just insensitive."I remember it well. Muslims and Sudanese are the new flavour of the decade for bigots. I wonder who will be the next group of people they decide to blame for their own failures while frothing at the mouth."Yeah, when I first came to Australia in the 90s, people were like “You Vietnamese people, coming over here with all your drugs!” I was like “I’m from Hong Kong”.""Its ok, I think they all look the same too. “Like pigs in a trough, politicians that is..........”"Our ministers are still like..."to be fair, it's difficult to tell someone's ethnicity/background from their appearance alone. hence why it's not good to assume."Lola SuCereza at least he was using a welcoming greeting difficult to know similar nationalities at times can’t see anyone being offended by this😊"He assumed her ethnicity? Because she looked Asian? Implying they all look the same. If you don't know, just ask. It quite simple."Elizabeth Goodare or just say hello in English?"Elizabeth Goodare  as an asian, i’m definitely not offended just stumped that our prime minister didn’t just say hi like a normal person. like wouldn’t that have been the easier and more logical action? 🤔🤯"David Le Goon 👍... but not what the New Zealander PM did eh!watch him try and cover up this faster than engadine maccasEmily Chen you are a funny girl🙋‍♀️💖💖 Hope you and Matt are both well darling. CxxxxxLani Brooks when people ask me where I'm from in Africa 😂 or that guy who tried to talk to me in Swahili."Huh.. Funny, I always thought that children had to be y'know.. born before they were children? I think the term you're looking for is fetus, and removing them isn't murder.""A fetus, is an unborn child. So that particular point your making is irrelevant.""Jayden Mooy, 'funny' how at 5 weeks you can hear the baby's heartbeat - you know, that same one inside us. 'Funny', how you can make out a beautiful face, defined fingers and toes by 12 weeks  - the same stuff we have. And yet, you're still happy to look them in the eyes (which they have) and say ""you are not human, we don't want you""? Doesn't sound very funny to me."Sarah Hatton I mean I wouldn’t call the face beautiful. At 12 weeks they’re still more alien looking than human. Overall though I do agree with you in part.Still not your choice what other women do with their bodies."Yeah yeah , whatever Sarah ,just you worry about your self and your super righteous body.""Sarah Hatton so if abortion is murder you don’t use an eraser? or white-out? because there are no mistakes right?  i mean, for some it wasn’t even a choice of whether or not they were penetrated, but go off i guess 🤷🏻‍♀️""Robin Targett rare and unfortunate cases where abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother, or in circumstances where consent was not given, should not be used as justification for the majority of abortions performed for 'convenience'.""Robin Targett if you’re referencing an actual woman who was so mistreated and is contemplating an abortion, please let us know.  There are people at Sarah’s (and my) church who would be honoured to support this woman and her beautiful unborn baby."Sarah Hatton You are a really ignorant young woman."Tim Chavura Are you going to pay someones rent for 18 years? Provide after school care, day care fees? Or do you mean buying a bag of nappies,making a fuss over the baby, saying a prayer and talking about how great you and god are? Also get OUT of women's business.""Yes, how dare someone inconvenience a WOMAN with another human life!""Jayden Mooy haha, they don't even know that to become a human you have to pass through the magic vagina first! Hahaha #SCIENZE!!!!""Michelle thanks for your comments Michelle, they've really added value to this discussion..!  Raising a child is the job of a community. No mother should be alone in this. I don't think the issue of abortion can be solved so simply, of course I can help, but it is the attitude of our communities that needs to change - this is why it is important what the government chooses to do about it - if they don't want abortions so easily accessible, there are lots of support services that need improvements and alternatives made accessible to mothers so that they and their little ones can be fully supported.  Furthermore, I think it is everybody's business what happens to the unborn. An 'each to their own' response is not warranted when human lives are in the balance."Michelle Jones I’m talking to Robin who may know someone in need.  I think you’re just trying to use the plights of destitute mums to win Facebook debates."No he just tortured children in his offshore concentration camps.  But at least he stopped the boats, right?"Ah ScoMo. We all make mistakes...
